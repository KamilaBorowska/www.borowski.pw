title:  An announcement of things to come
---

On January 1, 2012, I created my [GitHub account][github-account]. The plan back then was to contribute to free software as a [New Year's resolution][new-year-resolution] --- which was successful. Five years of contributions, I have learned a lot and got a job in a software industry. Still, I haven't had a blog.

Currently, this blog is mostly an experiment. The plan is to write articles every two weeks. It is unfinished, due to its domain being registered for a year without nothing done with it. Due to that a [minimal viable product][minimal-viable-product] was created instead of a fully finished blog with all bells and whistles.

Also, happy new year 2018!
